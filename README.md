# signal-call-bot

This was a bot created using the Binance, Discord, and Google Vision APIs to detect cryptocurrency market trends. During the cryptocurrency-boom of 2017/2018, there were a number of "pump and dump" groups that would buy a lot of a coin together, and immediately sell it. This bot attempted to predict these schemes before they occured by monitoring Binance price activity and Discord group activity.
