# signal-call-bot

This was a bot created using the Binance, Discord, and Google Vision APIs. During the cryptocurrency boom in 2017/2018 there were "pump and dump" groups that would buy a lot of one coin and sell it immediately after. Generally, the admins of these groups would purchase the coin in advance en masse, and dump them onto the members of the group. This bot attempted to predict what coins were going to be targets of a pump and dump before it took place.
